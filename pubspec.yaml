  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true
  fonts:
    - family: SavourIcons
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/SavourIcons.ttf

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/login_background.jpg
    - images/permissions.jpg
    - images/Savour_Deals_White.png
    - images/Savour_Deals_FullColor-white-back.png

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  # - family: SavourIcons
  #   fonts:
  #     - asset: fonts/SavourIcons.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
